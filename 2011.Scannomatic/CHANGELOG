*** Manual hardcoded xml production to reduce memory foot print.

*** In xml <cells> and <cell> where changed to <grid-cells> and
    <grid-cell>. <grid-cells>, <plates>, <scans> can only hold
    <grid-cell>, <plate>, <scan> respectively.

  ##################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.98 #####
   ##################################

*** Analysis is now done in grayscale-values and not pixel values

*** Inserted <time></time> in xml per scan

  ##################################

   ##################################

*** Fixed some more bugs in analysis

*** Bugs were fixed with grid array analysis.

*** Signal from grid array analysis is now processed using
    the frequency to account for missed spikes and false
    positives.

*** Recouperated the fixture settings so they work again

*** Inserted a cutoff for how much the grid may change from time
    to time, if more - it uses previous settings

  ##################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.96 #####
   ##################################

*** Analysis modules were implemented for detecting the grid of
    cells given a plate-rectangle.

*** Entire project analysis was added, but not yet with a GUI

*** Log file maker can now be run post scanning is complete and
    will produce the same inforamtion about the images as
    normal on the fly-logging. The first post with info on the
    experiment cannot be created though.

*** Included IQR mean as a measurement

  ##################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.95 #####
   ##################################

*** Analyse One GUI now with interactive selection showing the
    analysis of said selections with graphs and all.

*** Fixture GUI refurnish started with interactive selection of
    areas.

*** Fixed experiment log writing so that no arrays are logged
    (typecast as lists). Also, fixted so that the area-coordinates
    are logged and not the pixels throughout the area

*** Implemented Otsu thresholding as fallback blob detection method

*** Made a config view

*** Colonies analysis started

  ##################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.94 #####
   ##################################

*** Implemented a DMS (print/log/gui-message handling function)
    Started converting all print to DMS

*** Made single scan be an experiment

*** Interface for analysing one is there (no analysis is run yet)

*** Matplotlib embedded canvases capture events.
    (Still lacking the possibility to redraw nicely)

*** Fixed bug that crashed the project log generation

*** Fixed so that DMS-gui lets user know when image is comleted

  ##################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.93 #####
   ##################################

*** Almost total restructuring of where code goes to make it more
    modular.

  ##################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.92 #####
   ##################################

*** Only marker detection is done at 150 dpi, grayscale detection
    and output of coordinates is done at 600 dpi

*** Labels have a nice max-width so GUI behaves better

*** Made create experiment section more flexible

*** All plate-areas are written to log-file

*** Added numeric pattern support in simple_conf

  ##################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.91 #####
   ##################################

*** Log Maker puts timestamp for each entry which more or less
    equals the time at scanning plus some seconds

*** Fixed bugs in grayscale analysis

*** Analysis understands image scaling (so you can find markers
    on downsized version and then extract sections in the full
    scale image)

*** Locked scanning when experiment is running,
    in principle there's only support for one scanner still

*** Scan one image is now saying that it does something and
    behaves better in general

*** Impossible to start two experiments (one the same scanner)

*** simple_conf now reads the logfiles and just indexes every
    entry starting at zero for the first

*** Nicer not yet implemented features

  #################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.9 #####
   #################################

*** Grayscale is now in scale section on X-axis

*** Application has a config file and knows its
    relevant paths

*** Data is no longer stored where the application is
    (if you don't happen to actually want that)

*** Only one configuration view is visible at a time

*** Changed shutdown and rescan delay from 10s to 20s

*** Experiment saves marker positions and grayscale data.

  #################################

   #################################

*** Automatic gray-scale aqcuired

  #################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.7 #####
   #################################

*** Image offsetting and rotation in relation of fixture markings
    Has not been debugged

*** Made a class out of the fixture making and a subclass for the fixture
    settings

*** Included more configurations to fixtures and better GUI behaviour

*** An 'Analyse One Image' GUI is in dev. It produces strange slices of 
    the image.

  #################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.6 #####
   #################################

*** Automatic detection of markers done in 150dpi which give better results 
    and also at low process cost

*** Fixtures have a GUI for their setup and marking of zones in the image
    so that all fixture elements can be specified, in prototype mode though

*** Config File module implemented

  #################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.5 #####
   #################################

*** Automatic detection of orientation markers done in high-res, needs to be
    scaled down to low-res due to CPU time it takes.

*** Linux-mode also produces log file and generates a histogram graph on the
    fly

  #################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.4 #####
   #################################

*** The file scannomatic.py was split up into sub-modules (in directory src)
*   There might be bugs in windows from this, not yet dealt with

*** Directory images was created under source holding suggested markings for
    automatic fixture orientation (and maybe fixture version detection)

*** Linux scanning routines are now created as subprocess during experiments.
    That makes the program user friendly, and work with several scanners.

*** Image analysis of orientation through marker detection started. Far from
    done though (image_deconstruction.py)

  #################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.3 #####
   #################################

*** File naming format changed to leading zeros making lexical ordering simpler

*** CHANGELOG established

*** INSTALL established
