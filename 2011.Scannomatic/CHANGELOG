*** Calibration curve to transfer data from 'Kodak Value Space' to 
    'Cell Estimate Space' done for BY4743 using ten randomly omitted
    points as a test set and obtaining near 1:1 correlation between 
    calculated cell estimate and independent measure.

        y = 3.3797963108805451e-05x‚Åµ + 48.990614276885069x


*** Corrected bug that turned stuff up-side-down when running watch on
    a colony while producing analysis for a whole project.

*** Made Analyse One GUI more self-explaining

*** Calibration measures are no longer mean pixel-darkening, but vectors of
    all pixels that corresponds to an independent cell count.

*** In subracting background:mean negative values for blob in calibration
    is not allowed.

*** Cells now count as positive values relative to background

*** Calibration point saving saves a representation of the Kodak Value Space-
    vector that exactly represents the Cell Estimate

*** Improved orthagonal grayscale detection to more robust methods.

*** Changed the was median, IQR and IQR_mean is calculated to have
    better control of these parameters.

*** Corrected error and inefficient calculation of mean for the
    different grid-items

*** Included Unit Test code for grid placement by random removal of
    spikes detected. Outcome is generally good, but wrong placement
    happens frequently, but not always, when first or last true peak
    is not detected. The R-correction should take care of it though.

*** Grid R-value threshold increased as result of monitoring analysis.
    Unit test code in place.

*** Implementation of calibration.py started, based on file
    calibration.data in src/config (created from taking measures
    in Analyse One-view.

*** Gray-scale selection is now quite user-friendly

*** Canvases are re-usable in analyse one and images that don't
    match the fixture will now load and give users a one-chance
    at selecting the gs-area manually.

*** Analyse one view now gives values in Kodak value-space

*** Manual blob selection is now much less annoying

*** Manual blob selection in GUI-analysis implemented

*** Interim semi-sophisticated blob detection implemented,
    but only used through GUI-analysis

*** Draggable selections implemented in the GUI-analysis view

*** Manual size setting of selection in the GUI-analysis view

*** The inter-scan calibration is now done using a fitted
    3rd degree polynomial, currently translating pixel-values
    to Kodak target values (to be changed for a cell count
    estimate)

*** Hard-coded into the analysis, the program uses the Kodak
    gray-scale values.

*** Change to user specifying output dir - not file in analysis
    module

*** Analysis script saves grid-placement as a file for certain 
    time-points.

*** Grid-detection re-written using no heuristics (?!) and 
    producing much more robust grid-placement

*** Converted the project.py command-line behaviour to use
    argparser for increased user-friendliness. Added possibility
    to track a colony through the time-series to investigate
    the robustness of the analysis methods.

*** Manual hardcoded xml production to reduce memory foot print.

*** In xml <cells> and <cell> where changed to <grid-cells> and
    <grid-cell>. <grid-cells>, <plates>, <scans> can only hold
    <grid-cell>, <plate>, <scan> respectively.

  ##################################

*** Analysis is now done in grayscale-values and not pixel values

*** Inserted <time></time> in xml per scan

*** Fixed some more bugs in analysis

*** Bugs were fixed with grid array analysis.

*** Signal from grid array analysis is now processed using
    the frequency to account for missed spikes and false
    positives.

*** Recouperated the fixture settings so they work again

*** Inserted a cutoff for how much the grid may change from time
    to time, if more - it uses previous settings

  ##################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.96 #####
   ##################################

*** Analysis modules were implemented for detecting the grid of
    cells given a plate-rectangle.

*** Entire project analysis was added, but not yet with a GUI

*** Log file maker can now be run post scanning is complete and
    will produce the same inforamtion about the images as
    normal on the fly-logging. The first post with info on the
    experiment cannot be created though.

*** Included IQR mean as a measurement

  ##################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.95 #####
   ##################################

*** Analyse One GUI now with interactive selection showing the
    analysis of said selections with graphs and all.

*** Fixture GUI refurnish started with interactive selection of
    areas.

*** Fixed experiment log writing so that no arrays are logged
    (typecast as lists). Also, fixted so that the area-coordinates
    are logged and not the pixels throughout the area

*** Implemented Otsu thresholding as fallback blob detection method

*** Made a config view

*** Colonies analysis started

  ##################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.94 #####

*** Implemented a DMS (print/log/gui-message handling function)
    Started converting all print to DMS

*** Made single scan be an experiment

*** Interface for analysing one is there (no analysis is run yet)

*** Matplotlib embedded canvases capture events.
    (Still lacking the possibility to redraw nicely)

*** Fixed bug that crashed the project log generation

*** Fixed so that DMS-gui lets user know when image is comleted

*** Almost total restructuring of where code goes to make it more
    modular.

  ##################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.92 #####

*** Only marker detection is done at 150 dpi, grayscale detection
    and output of coordinates is done at 600 dpi

*** Labels have a nice max-width so GUI behaves better

*** Made create experiment section more flexible

*** All plate-areas are written to log-file

*** Added numeric pattern support in simple_conf

  ##################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.91 #####
   ##################################

*** Log Maker puts timestamp for each entry which more or less
    equals the time at scanning plus some seconds

*** Fixed bugs in grayscale analysis

*** Analysis understands image scaling (so you can find markers
    on downsized version and then extract sections in the full
    scale image)

*** Locked scanning when experiment is running,
    in principle there's only support for one scanner still

*** Scan one image is now saying that it does something and
    behaves better in general

*** Impossible to start two experiments (one the same scanner)

*** simple_conf now reads the logfiles and just indexes every
    entry starting at zero for the first

*** Nicer not yet implemented features

  #################################

   #################################

*** Grayscale is now in scale section on X-axis

*** Application has a config file and knows its
    relevant paths

*** Data is no longer stored where the application is
    (if you don't happen to actually want that)

*** Only one configuration view is visible at a time

*** Changed shutdown and rescan delay from 10s to 20s

*** Experiment saves marker positions and grayscale data.

*** Image offsetting and rotation in relation of fixture markings
    Has not been debugged

*** Made a class out of the fixture making and a subclass for the fixture
    settings

*** Included more configurations to fixtures and better GUI behaviour

*** An 'Analyse One Image' GUI is in dev. It produces strange slices of 
    the image.

  #################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.6 #####

*** Automatic detection of markers done in 150dpi which give better results 
    and also at low process cost

*** Fixtures have a GUI for their setup and marking of zones in the image
    so that all fixture elements can be specified, in prototype mode though

*** Config File module implemented

  #################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.5 #####
   #################################

*** Automatic detection of orientation markers done in high-res, needs to be
    scaled down to low-res due to CPU time it takes.

*** Linux-mode also produces log file and generates a histogram graph on the
    fly

  #################################
##### Changed in Scannomatic 0.4 #####
   #################################

*** The file scannomatic.py was split up into sub-modules (in directory src)
*   There might be bugs in windows from this, not yet dealt with

*** Directory images was created under source holding suggested markings for
    automatic fixture orientation (and maybe fixture version detection)

*** Linux scanning routines are now created as subprocess during experiments.
    That makes the program user friendly, and work with several scanners.

*** Image analysis of orientation through marker detection started. Far from
    done though (image_deconstruction.py)
